Version 1.2 (Version Code=3)
====================
- Fixed reported GYROSCOPE units as rad/sec and not degrees.
- Changed PRESSURE sensor units to hPa (hectopascal) instead of KP.
- Added new Sensor.TYPE_AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE and Sensor.TYPE_RELATIVE_HUMIDITY
- Updated 'Uses SDK' to target SDK Revision 15 per suggestions in post 
    http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2012/01/say-goodbye-to-menu-button.html
- Keep sensor display from rotating when displaying sensor data per user 
    feedback request. Sensor menu still allows screen rotation however.

Version 1.1 (Version Code=2)
====================
Bug Fix Update!

Apparently when Froyo came out, Android added 3 more sensors and many devices
have them. Normally a good thing, but due to a bug in my app when it discovered
those sensors it indexed beyond an array! Bummer, poor programming on my part.
But now it is fixed and hopefully will adapt if more sensors are added.

Version 1.0 (Version Code=1)
