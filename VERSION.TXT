Version 1.3 (Version Code=4)
====================
- Supports Android SDK v4 thru v19
- Removed deprecated sensor type constants and replaced with explicit values.
    This was done to help maintain backwards compatibility with as many
    Android API versions as possible.
- Removed use of managed dialogs from Activities as this has been deprecated
    by the API. Moved existing code to use FragmentActivity and DialogFragment 
    as recommended by Android. Please see: 
    http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/03/fragments-for-all.html
    for more details on the new API and how to incorporate a Android provided
    static library for backwards compatibility into APIv4.
    This does mean you now need to include a static library for this API
    as described in: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html
- To support FragmentActivity and DialogFragments, I took the opportunity
    to separate the 'about' and 'sensor rate change' dialog classes to
    their own separate modules. This doesn't change the operation of the app
    any, it just makes the code a bit more maintainable and readable.
- In general fixed as many Android Lint issues as possible. Most were pretty
    minor and did not affect the code function.
- Fixed issue #1 which requested a new feature that adds the ability to 
    prevent the screen from timing out.
- Fixed issue #2 which was to persist the sensor rate update setting as
    the sensor activity is changed. This way you can switch sensor views
    and the previously set rate will be maintained. This does not persist
    however in the file system. That doesn't seem like something people would
    want.
- Added a new menu item to reset all sensor update rates back to the default
    rate of NORMAL as a convenience.
    Fixed  issue #3 .
- Fixed issue #3 by adding code to check if a sensor already exists in the
    sensor list. If it does, do not add it.
- Added a sensor found counter at the top of the main screen banner.
    Let's you easily know how many sensors have been found.
- Deferred issue #4 as I cannot see any error with how I am reporting the
    time stamp as reported by the sensor. It appears to only work with slower
    sensors such as the light/prox sensors. Faster ones  like the gravity
    report very very large numbers. Remains a mystery. There appears to be
    a lot of chatter about this on the Android forums.
 - Fixed issue #5 by adding 7 new sensor types; Magnetic Field (Uncalibrated),
    Game Rotation Vector, Gyroscope (Uncalibrated), Significant Motion Detector,
    Step Counter, Step Detector, and Geomagnetic Rotation Vector.
 - Added new 'sensor values' field to to the sensor static view to help
    indicate how many values to expect.
 - Added new sensor view menu option to set the event rate (just like the
    button does).
 - Refactored how the SensorView handles indexing into and defining interfaces
    for existing sensors. Hopefully made it more flexible to handle unknown 
    sensors as well as being able to add new sensors more easily.

Version 1.2 (Version Code=3)
====================
- Fixed reported GYROSCOPE units as rad/sec and not degrees.
- Changed PRESSURE sensor units to hPa (hectopascal) instead of KP.
- Added new Sensor.TYPE_AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE and Sensor.TYPE_RELATIVE_HUMIDITY
- Updated 'Uses SDK' to target SDK Revision 15 per suggestions in post 
    http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2012/01/say-goodbye-to-menu-button.html
- Keep sensor display from rotating when displaying sensor data per user 
    feedback request. Sensor menu still allows screen rotation however.

Version 1.1 (Version Code=2)
====================
Bug Fix Update!

Apparently when Froyo came out, Android added 3 more sensors and many devices
have them. Normally a good thing, but due to a bug in my app when it discovered
those sensors it indexed beyond an array! Bummer, poor programming on my part.
But now it is fixed and hopefully will adapt if more sensors are added.

Version 1.0 (Version Code=1)
====================
