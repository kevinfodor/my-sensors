  * Supports Android SDK v4 thru v20
  * Removed deprecated sensor type constants and replaced with explicit 
  values. This was done to help maintain backwards compatibility with as 
  many Android API versions as possible.
  * Removed use of managed dialogs from Activities as this has been deprecated 
  by the API. Moved existing code to use FragmentActivity and DialogFragment 
  as recommended by Android. Please see: http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/03/fragments-for-all.html 
  for more details on the new API and how to incorporate a Android provided 
  static library for backwards compatibility into APIv4. This does mean you 
  now need to include a static library for this API as described in: 
  http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html
  * To support FragmentActivity and DialogFragments, I took the opportunity 
  to separate the 'about' and 'sensor rate change' dialog classes to their 
  own separate modules. This doesn't change the operation of the app any, 
  it just makes the code a bit more maintainable and readable.
  * In general fixed as many Android Lint issues as possible. Most were 
  pretty minor and did not affect the code function.
  * Fixed issue #1 which requested a new feature that adds the ability to 
  prevent the screen from timing out.
  * Fixed issue #2 which was to persist the sensor rate update setting as 
  the sensor activity is changed. This way you can switch sensor views and 
  the previously set rate will be maintained. This does not persist however 
  in the file system. That doesn't seem like something people would want.
  * Added a new menu item to reset all sensor update rates back to the default 
  rate of NORMAL as a convenience.
  * Fixed issue #3 by adding code to check if a sensor already exists in the 
  sensor list. If it does, do not add it.
  * Added a sensor found counter at the top of the main screen banner. Let's 
  you easily know how many sensors have been found.
  * Deferred issue #4 as I cannot see any error with how I am reporting the 
  time stamp as reported by the sensor. It appears to only work with slower 
  sensors such as the light/prox sensors. Faster ones  like the gravity 
  report very very large numbers. Remains a mystery. There appears to be a 
  lot of chatter about this on the Android forums.
  * Fixed issue #5 by adding 7 new sensor types; Magnetic Field 
  (Uncalibrated), Game Rotation Vector, Gyroscope (Uncalibrated), Significant 
  Motion Detector, Step Counter, Step Detector, and Geomagnetic 
  Rotation Vector.
  * Added new 'sensor values' field to to the sensor static view to help 
  indicate how many values to expect.
  * Added new sensor view menu option to set the event rate (just like the 
  button does).
  * Refactored how the SensorView handles indexing into and defining 
  interfaces for existing sensors. Hopefully made it more flexible to handle 
  unknown sensors as well as being able to add new sensors more easily.
  * Fixed issue #6 by adding the ability to toggle screen rotation via the 
  menu. Additionally the rotation selected is persisted.
  * Fixed issue #7 by no longer passing data from the main MySensors activity 
  to the SensorView activity. Instead the SensorView activity learns which 
  sensor to display by being passed an index which maps back to the sensor. 
  Before this was fixed, whenever Android went through garbage collection to 
  reclaim resources and the main MySensors activity was destroyed, it would
  release the memory which was being referenced to display the chosen sensor 
  and then would crash.
  * Fixed issue #8 which was to add the ability to disable the logging to 
  logcat so that sensor reporting is a quick as possible.
  * Few last minute additions. Added a new start/stop toggle button which 
  allows you to freeze and run the sensor display much like a stop watch.
  * Added a Reset Counter button to allow the user to reset the accumulated 
  event counter as needed.
  * Removed the set rate button since it can already be easily done via the 
  android menu button.
  * Fixed up remaining lint issues.

==Version 1.2 (Version Code=3)==
Download: [https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8_Aotc206N6V29FejlVTUJhMkE&usp=sharing MySensors_v1.2]

  * Fixed reported GYROSCOPE units as rad/sec and not degrees.
  * Changed PRESSURE sensor units to hPa (hectopascal) instead of KP.
  * Added new Sensor.TYPE_AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE and Sensor.TYPE_RELATIVE_HUMIDITY
  * Updated 'Uses SDK' to target SDK 'Revision- 15' per suggestions in post: 
  [http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2012/01/say-goodbye-to-menu-button.html Say Goodbye To Menu Button]
  * Keep sensor display from rotating when displaying sensor data per user 
  feedback request. Sensor menu still allows screen rotation however.

==Version 1.1 (Version Code=2)==

Bug Fix Update!

  * Apparently when Froyo came out, Android added 3 more sensors and many 
  devices have them. Normally a good thing, but due to a bug in my app when 
  it discovered those sensors it indexed beyond an array! Bummer, poor 
  programming on my part. But now it is fixed and hopefully will adapt 
  if more sensors are added.
