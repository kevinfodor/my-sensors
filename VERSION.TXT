Version 1.3 (Version Code=4)
====================
- Supports Android SDK v4 thru v19
- Removed deprecated sensor type constants and replaced with explicit values.
    This was done to help maintain backwards compatibility with as many
    Android API versions as possible.
- Removed use of managed dialogs from Activities as this has been deprecated
    by the API. Moved existing code to use FragmentActivity and DialogFragment 
    as recommended by Android. Please see: 
    http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/03/fragments-for-all.html
    for more details on the new API and how to incorporate a Android provided
    static library for backwards compatibility into APIv4.
    This does mean you now need to include a static library for this API
    as described in: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html
- To support FragmentActivity and DialogFragments, I took the opportunity
    to separate the 'about' and 'sensor rate change' dialog classes to
    their own separate modules. This doesn't change the operation of the app
    any, it just makes the code a bit more maintainable and readable.
- In general fixed as many Android Lint issues as possible. Most were pretty
    minor and did not affect the code function.

Version 1.2 (Version Code=3)
====================
- Fixed reported GYROSCOPE units as rad/sec and not degrees.
- Changed PRESSURE sensor units to hPa (hectopascal) instead of KP.
- Added new Sensor.TYPE_AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE and Sensor.TYPE_RELATIVE_HUMIDITY
- Updated 'Uses SDK' to target SDK Revision 15 per suggestions in post 
    http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2012/01/say-goodbye-to-menu-button.html
- Keep sensor display from rotating when displaying sensor data per user 
    feedback request. Sensor menu still allows screen rotation however.

Version 1.1 (Version Code=2)
====================
Bug Fix Update!

Apparently when Froyo came out, Android added 3 more sensors and many devices
have them. Normally a good thing, but due to a bug in my app when it discovered
those sensors it indexed beyond an array! Bummer, poor programming on my part.
But now it is fixed and hopefully will adapt if more sensors are added.

Version 1.0 (Version Code=1)
